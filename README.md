# Project Currently Under Construction

Progress is currently made towards an assembly manual covering how to build and tune this printer, though it's possible to build it from just the BOM and referencing the 3D model in Blender.

If sourcing the components are hard or expensive, please wait for the kit of this printer as I am determined to make it a reality.
